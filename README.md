Certifications: Cisco CCNA, Cisco DevNet Associate

Currently Studying: Cisco CCNP

üß≠ Overview
-----------------------------------
This repository documents my 12-week journey to design, deploy, and administer core network security controls in a virtual lab environment.

Technologies covered:

  - Network Access Control (NAC) ‚Äì PacketFence / Cisco ISE
  - Network Detection & Response (NDR) ‚Äì Zeek / Security Onion
  - Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) ‚Äì Suricata / Snort
  - Firewall / NGFW ‚Äì pfSense / OPNsense / Palo Alto VM

Goal:
Gain practical, end-to-end experience building a secure enterprise network, integrating controls for visibility, prevention, and response.

üß© Lab Architecture
--------------------------------------------
Components:
  - Virtualization: VirtualBox / VMware
  - OS: Ubuntu Server, Windows Server, Windows 10 Client, Kali Linux
  - Network Controls:
      1.NAC: PacketFence + FreeRADIUS
      2.NDR: Zeek / Security Onion
      3.IPS: Suricata (inline mode on pfSense)
      4.Firewall: pfSense
      5.SIEM (optional): Wazuh / Graylog

Sample Topology Diagram:
[Client VM] ‚Üí [Switch/VLAN] ‚Üí [NAC] ‚Üí [Firewall (pfSense)] ‚Üí [IPS/Suricata] ‚Üí [Internet]
                                        ‚Ü≥ [NDR/Zeek Sensor] ‚Ü≥ [SIEM]

üß† Learning Objectives
-------------------------------------------
Understand how each control fits into a layered defense strategy.

Deploy and configure open-source or enterprise-grade equivalents.

Detect, prevent, and respond to simulated threats.

Integrate logging and event correlation across all layers.

Produce professional documentation and operational insights.

üß™ Lab Details
--------------------------------------------
üî∏ NAC (Network Access Control)
Objective: Enforce endpoint authentication and posture-based access.
Key Activities:
  Configure 802.1X authentication with FreeRADIUS
  Create guest and BYOD onboarding policies
  Assign VLANs based on compliance status
  Simulate compliant and non-compliant devices

üî∏ NDR (Network Detection & Response)
---------------------------------------------
Objective: Monitor and analyze network traffic for anomalies.
Key Activities:

Deploy Zeek/Security Onion to capture and inspect flows

Generate malicious traffic using Kali Linux

Analyze Zeek logs (conn.log, dns.log, http.log)

Create basic detection scripts and dashboards

üî∏ IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
---------------------------------------------
Objective: Segment, control, and secure network traffic.
Key Activities:

Configure firewall rules (inbound/outbound)

Set up NAT, DMZ, and VPNs

Test rule enforcement and logging

Explore NGFW concepts (App-ID, SSL inspection)

üîó Integration & SIEM
----------------------------------------------
Goal: Combine all controls into a unified detection and response flow.

Steps:

Route NAC VLANs through pfSense.

Mirror traffic to Zeek/NDR sensor.

Inline Suricata IPS for prevention.

Forward logs to Wazuh/Graylog SIEM.

Correlate alerts and document incidents.

Result:
Full visibility from endpoint access ‚Üí network detection ‚Üí prevention ‚Üí response.

üìò Key Takeaways
------------------------------------------------
Learned to integrate multiple open-source and enterprise-grade tools.

Gained practical experience with traffic analysis, detection tuning, and access control.

Built a reusable virtual lab for continuous experimentation.

Developed documentation and reporting skills relevant to SOC and NetSec roles.
